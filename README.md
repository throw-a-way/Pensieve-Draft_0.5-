# Pensieve - The Wannabe Extended Brain App  
Because remembering things is hard, and we ain't got time for that.  

## Features & Roadmap (aka Things I Swear I'll Do... Eventually)  

- **Personal Knowledge Management System** (Fancy way of saying "Dump all my thoughts somewhere")  
- **Authentication Revamp**: Ditching Token-Based Auth for **Authkit (Session + Cookie-Based Auth)** because its easier  
- **UI Overhaul**: The current UI is just shitty ui created by me. But soon, it'll actually look good I'll use some UI Library.  
- **"AI-Powered" Magic**: **Vector Embeddings type shit** so it actually works (Estimated time May 2025).  
- 🏛 **Qdrant as the Database**: or supabase idk.  
- ✍️ **More Drafts Coming Soon...** (Translation: I'll keep breaking things and fixing them later.)

> **Note**: This project is still in early development. By "early," I mean "it barely works."
